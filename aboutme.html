<h1>About Me</h1>

<h4>I am a personal mortgage advisor, with experience managing and coaching stakeholders.
  My background is from sales and account management and I moved into finance 6 years ago
  as I’m passionate about making a difference to customers lives.
  I’m always eager to learn more about finance as I continue my knowledge studying for
  level 4 in financial advice and stay in tune with the latest news through reading and listening to podcasts.<br>

<br>
My hunger for knowledge and keeping up to date has allowed me to have 100% compliance and file checks in my work,
achieving my targets while also passing R01 and R05.<br>
<br>
My hobbies include Running, coding and reading.  Reach out to chrisrsmith28@gmail.com to connect!
